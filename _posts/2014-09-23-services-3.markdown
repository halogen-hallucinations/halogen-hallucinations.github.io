Keyboard noise refers to the errors that originate in the process of typing â€“ specifically, we focus on misspellings caused by keyboard layouts rather than user misconception. These typos might present a challenge when queries are entered into a search engine, and we find that a simple spellchecker might not be enough to combat them.
